The experimental hardware configuration includes a personal computer featuring an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6226R CPU with a clock speed of 2.90 GHz and 128 GB of RAM. The system runs on Windows 11 and utilizes Matlab2023a to run all the experiments.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have put a demo code of the "Wave-RVFL" model with the "adult" dataset.

For the demo purpose, following hyperparameters set used for the experiment. To get the optimal results, please tune the hyperparameters. For the detailed experimental setup, please refer to the supplementary material of the paper.
